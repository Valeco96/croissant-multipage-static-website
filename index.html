      A croissant is a French pastry in a crescent shape made from a laminated
      yeast dough similar to puff pastry. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie
      pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French
      yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical
      crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry.
